## Phononic Bandgap Predictor and Inverse Design App using Neural Networks

This repository contains a MATLAB application for predicting the bandgap ratio and performing inverse design of phononic crystals using a trained neural network. The tool leverages advanced machine learning techniques to optimize and tailor phononic crystal structures for specific bandgap properties. Key features include:

- **Bandgap Ratio Prediction**: Accurately predicts the bandgap ratio of phononic crystals using a trained neural network model.
- **Inverse Design**: Facilitates the design of phononic crystals with desired bandgap properties through an inverse design approach.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: MATLAB-based graphical interface for ease of use and accessibility.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed instructions and examples to guide users through installation, usage, and customization.
